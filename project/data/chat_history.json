Have you noticed any other symptoms such as dizziness, fever, or abdominal pain? It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment, but I can provide some general information that may help.\n\nVomiting can be caused by a variety of factors, including gastrointestinal issues, food poisoning, infection, or other medical conditions. If you're experiencing persistent or severe vomiting, it's important to seek medical attention right away. In the meantime, here are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, such as water, clear broths, or electrolyte-rich drinks like coconut water or sports drinks. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can exacerbate dehydration.\n2. Rest: Take it easy and get plenty of rest to allow your body to recover. Aim for at least 8-10 hours of sleep each night.\n3. Avoid solid foods: For now, stick to a bland diet of liquids and soft, easily digestible foods like crackers or toast. Avoid spicy, fatty, or greasy foods that can irritate your stomach.\n4. Monitor your symptoms: Keep track of any changes in your symptoms, such as worsening nausea, abdominal pain, or fever. This information can be helpful for your healthcare provider when they evaluate you.\n5. Consider over-the-counter medications: If your vomiting is caused by an upset stomach or acid reflux, you may want to try an antacid or anti-nausea medication. However, always consult with a healthcare professional before taking any medication.\n\nRemember, while I can provide general information and advice, only a qualified healthcare professional can properly diagnose and treat your condition. Please don't hesitate to seek medical attention if your symptoms persist or worsen over time."

This means you have a lower chance of developing serious health problems compared to those with higher risk levels. However, it's always important to maintain good health habits and visit healthcare professionals regularly for check-ups to ensure your health remains optimal.\n\nNow, let's take a closer look at some of the data you provided. Your weight is within a healthy range, which is excellent! Maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce the risk of various diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Keep up the good work!\n\nYour blood pressure readings are also within a normal range, which is great news! High blood pressure can increase your risk of developing serious health problems, so it's important to keep it under control through lifestyle changes (such as exercising regularly) and, if necessary, medication.\n\nYour heart rate is slightly higher than average, but this isn't cause for concern just yet. However, I would recommend regular exercise to help keep your heart healthy and strong. Remember, a strong heart can help pump blood more efficiently throughout your body!\n\nYour glucose level is also within a healthy range, which is fantastic news! Consistently high blood sugar levels can lead to serious health problems, so it's important to maintain a balanced diet and exercise regularly to keep your glucose levels under control.\n\nNow, I know you mentioned that you're not a smoker, but I must remind you that even occasional smoking can increase your risk of developing serious health problems. If you ever feel tempted to smoke, please reach out to me or a healthcare professional for support.\n\nFinally, it's great to see that you get enough sleep and don't consume excessive alcohol! Both are important factors in maintaining good health. Remember, getting enough restful sleep can help improve your mood, cognitive function, and overall well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, you're doing a fantastic job with your health so far! Just keep up the good work by maintaining a balanced lifestyle, visiting healthcare professionals regularly, and staying informed about your health.

      "ai_response": "Hello there! *supportive smile* Sorry to hear that you're experiencing a severe headache and other cold symptoms. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for any persistent or severe symptoms, as they can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment. However, I can offer some general insights and home care steps that might be helpful in the meantime.\n\nBased on the information provided, it's possible that you have a viral infection such as the common cold or flu. The headache, stuffy nose, fever, and other symptoms are all common symptoms of these conditions. If your symptoms persist or worsen over time, it's important to seek medical attention.\n\nIn the meantime, there are some home care steps you can take to help manage your symptoms:\n\n1. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, tea, or soup, to help loosen mucus and reduce fever.\n2. Rest: Getting enough rest can help your body recover from the infection more quickly.\n3. Use over-the-counter medications: Pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help alleviate headaches, while decongestants like pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine can help reduce nasal congestion. However, always follow the recommended dosage instructions and consult with a healthcare professional before taking any medication.\n4. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands frequently, avoid close contact with others, and avoid sharing utensils or personal items to prevent the spread of infection.\n5. Use a humidifier: Dry air can exacerbate cold symptoms. Using a humidifier can help add moisture to the air and relieve nasal congestion.\n\nRemember, if your symptoms worsen or you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, or confusion, seek medical attention immediately. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health.\n\nPlease keep me updated on your condition, and feel free to ask any questions or share any concerns you may have. *encouraging smile*"
